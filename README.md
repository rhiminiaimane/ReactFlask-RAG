#  Cancer Treatment Assistant

The **Cancer Treatment Assistant** is an intelligent medical document question-answering system that helps users—patients, healthcare professionals, and researchers—extract relevant information from medical PDFs using natural language queries. It combines modern NLP techniques, vector search, and LLMs to provide accurate and contextual answers.

---

##  Overview

This system processes cancer-related documents, embeds them for semantic search, and retrieves relevant answers using an **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** Model.
It features a clean frontend interface and a robust Flask backend.

---

##  System Architecture

The architecture is composed of four main layers:

![System Architecture](./screenshots/architecture.jpg)

1. **Medical Document Ingestion**

   * Format: PDF
   * Extracted using `PyPDF2`

2. **Preprocessing & Chunking**

   * Chunked for better semantic retrieval
   * Embedded using Sentence Transformers

3. **Embedding & Indexing**

   * Indexed with FAISS for efficient vector search
   * Similarity-based retrieval

4. **Query Answering**

   * Query passed through FAISS retriever
   * Context fed to Gemini 1.5 Flash API
   * Generated answer returned to the user
